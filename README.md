# OpenMechanics

# OpenMechanics' development has been suspended until further notice. This is due to me not having a team, which would be required to maintain a mod planned to be this large. If you would like to join my team to help, please DM me on Discord (Paradoxical#2936).

Adds new ores and things. This branch currently contains the development for version 2.0.
