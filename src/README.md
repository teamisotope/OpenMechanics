### WARNING
This source is still being developed and is uncompatible with 1.10! This is the 1.8 source! It will be replaced by 1.10 code procedurally.
This source (once confirmed) is still unstable. This is literally (in coding terms) the bleeding edge. The full releases will be marked by releases, tags, or releases on Curse/CurseForge.
